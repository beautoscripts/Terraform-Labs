Terraform Providers
==================

Terraform rely on the cloud api pluings to manage there resources. These plugins are called providers.
The very first block of configuration required in the terraform configuration file is the providers.

Terraform Variables
===================
In terraform configuration file a variable can be defined with the same configuration file or it can be declare in seprate file.

- Syntax
  variable "my_variable" {
      type          = string or boolean or number
      default       = <here we give the default value>
      description   = <here we give description about the variable>
  }

  - We can create a seprate file example variable.tf and declare the variable same as above.
  - Accessing the variable in the terraform configuration file we need to give var.variable_name.
  - In variable.tf file if we don't give the default value and run terraform apply, we will be prompt for input. In order to avoid this either we give the default value or for dynamic variable input we can create a file called 'terraform.tfvars' and give the value for the variable which is declare in the 'variable.tf' file.
  - terraform.tfvars ( this needs to be the exact name )
  - In case we need to use other name and terraform should automatically take input from that file, in that case the name of the file should be '<filename>.auto.tfvars'
  - We can also pass the name of the variable file using '-var-file <name of variable file>' during terraform apply.
  - We can also pass the variable value '-var="<my_variable=vairable_value>"
